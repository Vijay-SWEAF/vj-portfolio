      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-justify">
        My self-learning journey began in the early years of the 21st century, fueled by a strong curiosity for systems, automation, and creative problem-solving. 
        What started as a hobby gradually aligned with my professional career in the shipping and logistics domain 🚢, where I gained hands-on experience across both domestic and multinational organizations. 
        Over time, I nurtured a deep passion for technology 🧠 — not only streamlining operational workflows and automating processes in my work environment, but also exploring web development, app creation, design, 
        and productivity tools through my personal interests.
        <br /><br />
        Academically, I earned a <strong>Graduate degree in Management & Accountancy</strong> from the <strong>University of Mumbai 🎓</strong>. 
        Along the way, I pursued a <strong>Master Diploma in Systems & Softwares 💾</strong> from a private institute to deepen my understanding of computing fundamentals and programming.
        <br /><br />
        My learning never really stopped. I continued sharpening my creative and technical edge through certifications — including <strong>Adobe Applications 🎨</strong> via <strong>Udemy Alumni</strong>, 
        and more recently through <strong>HarvardX (edX)</strong> where I'm progressing through the world-class <strong>CS50 series 💻</strong>: 
        <em>Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</em>, <em>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python</em>, and 
        <em>Introduction to Computer Science</em>. Some of these are complete, while others are ongoing — because I'm always upgrading!
        <br /><br />
        Today, I contribute within my organization’s <strong>Information Technology department 💼</strong>, leveraging this passion 
        to build tools that enhance operational clarity, efficiency, and accuracy. From creating <strong>internal dashboards 📊</strong> 
        to optimizing data workflows, I continuously bridge domain expertise with modern tools.
        <br /><br />
        Outside of work, I explore <strong>web development 🌐</strong>, <strong>UI/UX design 🎨</strong>, and <strong>cloud technologies ☁️</strong> 
        — not just as hobbies, but as ways to sharpen my skills and stay aligned with industry evolution. I am skilled in building 
        <strong>.NET-based web and desktop applications 💻</strong> and proficient in technologies like <strong>C#, VB, VBA, HTML, CSS, SQL</strong>, 
        and basic <strong>Python 🐍</strong>.
        <br /><br />
        My creative toolkit includes hands-on experience with the <strong>Adobe suite 🎬</strong>: <strong>Photoshop 🖌️</strong>, 
        <strong>Illustrator ✒️</strong>, <strong>Audition 🎧</strong>, <strong>Premiere Pro 🎞️</strong>, <strong>After Effects ✨</strong>, 
        <strong> Adobe Express 🚀, Blender 💡</strong>, and <strong>whiteboard animation 🧑‍🏫</strong>. I also explore emerging <strong>AI tools 🤖</strong> 
        to enhance visual content and productivity.
        <br /><br />
        In an era where many rely on AI to write code, I take pride in crafting software through my own <strong>logic, hands-on 
        problem-solving, and code understanding ⚙️🧩</strong>. I believe true innovation comes not just from using tools — but 
        from knowing how they work, and building them from the ground up.
        <br /><br />
        Some of my <strong>self-initiated prototypes 🛠️</strong> and internal experiments have evolved into real-world solutions, 
        delivering measurable value. Whether it’s building a <strong>logistics automation concept ⚙️</strong> or enhancing 
        <strong> user interfaces 🖱️</strong>, I aim to craft tech that works — efficiently, ethically, and with practical value.
